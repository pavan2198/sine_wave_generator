# Verilog Sine Wave Generator

This project demonstrates how to generate a sine wave of a fixed frequency using Verilog for implementation on an FPGA.

## Core Concept

The sine wave is generated using a **Look-Up Table (LUT)** method.
1.  **Pre-Calculation**: The values of one cycle of a sine wave are calculated beforehand and stored as a table in a Read-Only Memory (ROM).
2.  **Phase Accumulator**: A simple counter continuously cycles through the addresses of the ROM (0 to 255). This counter represents the current phase of the wave.
3.  **Clock Divider**: A clock divider is used to control the speed at which the phase accumulator increments. This speed directly sets the output frequency of the sine wave.

## Project Files

This repository contains three main files:

-   `generate_sine_rom.py`: A Python script that calculates the sine wave values and prints a synthesizable Verilog `case` statement for the ROM.
-   `sine_generator.sv`: The main Verilog design file. It contains the logic for the clock divider and phase accumulator. **You must paste the output from the Python script into this file.**
-   `tb_sine_generator.sv`: A SystemVerilog testbench used to simulate the design and verify its functionality.

## How to Use This Project

Follow these steps to generate a sine wave and simulate it.

### Step 1: Generate the LUT and Complete the Design

First, you need to generate the Verilog code for the Look-Up Table and insert it into the design file.

1.  From your terminal, run the Python script:
    ```bash
    python generate_sine_rom.py
    ```
    This will print a complete Verilog `case` statement to your console. **Copy the entire output**.

2.  Open the `sine_generator.sv` file in a text editor.

3.  Find the placeholder comment inside the file:
    ```verilog
    // --- PASTE THE SINE ROM `case` STATEMENT GENERATED BY YOUR PYTHON SCRIPT HERE ---
    ```
4.  Delete this line and **paste the Verilog code** you just copied from the terminal in its place. Save and close the file. Your design is now complete.

### Step 2: Run the Simulation

Now you can use a Verilog simulator like Vivado, ModelSim, or EDA Playground to run the project.

1.  Add `sine_generator.sv` as the design source.
2.  Add `tb_sine_generator.sv` as the simulation/testbench source.
3.  Set `tb_sine_generator` as the top module for the simulation.
4.  **Important**: Set the simulation run time to at least **`4 ms`** to see multiple cycles.
5.  Run the simulation. In the waveform viewer, add the `sine_out` signal and change its radix to **Analog** to see the final wave shape.

## Customizing the Output

You can change the output frequency and other properties by editing the parameters at the top of the `sine_generator.sv` file.

| Parameter      | Default Value | Description                                  |
| :------------- | :------------ | :------------------------------------------- |
| `SYS_CLK_FREQ` | `50_000_000`  | Your FPGA's main clock frequency (in Hz).      |
| `SINE_FREQ`    | `1_000`       | The desired output frequency of the sine wave (in Hz). |
| `LUT_DEPTH`    | `256`         | The number of samples per sine wave cycle.   |
| `DATA_WIDTH`   | `8`           | The bit-width (resolution) of the output data. |
